# Stacking-based-three-classifier-ensemble-for-remote-sensing-image-classification-
By studying three different multi classifier integration techniques, the effectiveness and feasibility of using Stacking based multi classifier integration to improve the classification accuracy of remote sensing images have been demonstrated, and the training efficiency of the model has been improved through band filtering.
